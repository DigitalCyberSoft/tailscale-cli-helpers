.TH TRSYNC 1 "July 2025" "Tailscale CLI Helpers 0.2.1" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
trsync \- rsync with Tailscale hostname resolution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trsync
[\fIrsync_options\fR] \fIsource\fR \fIdestination\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B trsync
provides rsync file synchronization functionality with automatic Tailscale hostname resolution. It resolves Tailscale hostnames in remote file specifications (host:path) to their MagicDNS names or IP addresses.
.SH OPTIONS
All options are passed directly to the underlying rsync command. Common options include:
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-archive
Archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (recursive, links, perms, times, group, owner, devices)
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity. Also enables hostname resolution debugging in trsync
.TP
.BR \-z ", " \-\-compress
Compress file data during transfer
.TP
.BR \-\-delete
Delete files in destination that don't exist in source
.TP
.BR \-\-exclude =\fIPATTERN\fR
Exclude files matching PATTERN
.TP
.BR \-\-dry\-run
Show what would be transferred without doing it
.TP
.BR \-P
Same as --partial --progress
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Sync directory to remote host:
.B trsync -av local_dir/ mynode:/remote/path/
.TP
Sync from remote host:
.B trsync -av mynode:/remote/path/ local_dir/
.TP
Sync with specific user:
.B trsync -av dir/ user@mynode:/path/
.TP
Mirror with deletion:
.B trsync -av --delete source/ mynode:/dest/
.TP
Exclude patterns:
.B trsync -av --exclude='*.log' dir/ mynode:/dir/
.TP
Dry run to preview:
.B trsync -av --dry-run source/ mynode:/dest/
.SH HOSTNAME RESOLUTION
\fBtrsync\fR automatically detects and resolves Tailscale hostnames:
.IP \(bu 4
Patterns like "hostname:path" are parsed for hostname resolution
.IP \(bu 4
Does not resolve rsync daemon syntax (hostname::module)
.IP \(bu 4
When using -v flag, shows hostname resolution details
.IP \(bu 4
Falls back to original hostname if not found in Tailscale network
.SH ADVANTAGES
rsync provides efficient file synchronization:
.IP \(bu 4
Only transfers changed portions of files
.IP \(bu 4
Preserves permissions, timestamps, and ownership
.IP \(bu 4
Supports compression and bandwidth limiting
.IP \(bu 4
Can resume interrupted transfers
.IP \(bu 4
Efficient for large directory trees
.SH DEPENDENCIES
Requires \fBrsync\fR to be installed. The command will not be available if rsync is not found in PATH.
